# Recontext

A Chrome extension for replacing quotations with silly nonsense randomly selected from the subreddit /r/nocontext. Be warned: the replacements are often obscene. 

## Try it for yourself

To try the extension, start by cloning the repository to your machine. Next, open up Chrome and navigate to the extensions page by way of More tools>Extensions. 
Click 'Load Unpacked' and select the repo's root directory in your local file system. There should now be a black-and-white icon in your Chrome toolbar. 
Find an article from your favorite news site (e.g. [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com)) and see what happens when you click the icon!
